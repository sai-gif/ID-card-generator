# ID-card-generator
This Python script automatically generates a single PDF file containing employee ID cards, with one ID per page. It utilizes a pre-defined ID template image, and data sourced from a CSV file containing employee names, titles, and photo file paths. Each employeeâ€™s photo is overlaid onto the ID template to produce a professional-looking ID card.
